1. fgets() works well because it reads one line at a time, prevents buffer overflow, and handles EOF properly.

2. We use malloc() for cmd_buff instead of a fixed-size array because it lets us allocate memory as needed, saves space, and avoids wasting memory on unused space.

3. Trimming spaces in build_cmd_list() is necessary to prevent errors, make sure commands are recognized correctly, and avoid unexpected issues when parsing input.

4. Examples of redirection and challenges:

    ls > output.txt sends output to a file (challenge: avoid overwriting existing data).
    ls 2> error.txt saves errors to a file (challenge: handle file permissions properly).
    ls > output.txt 2>&1 combines output and errors (challenge: keep them in the right order).

5. Redirection and piping are different because redirection (>, <) moves output to a file, while piping (|) sends it to another command to process further.

6. STDERR should stay separate from STDOUT so errors donâ€™t get mixed with normal output, making debugging easier and keeping logs clean.

7. The shell should handle errors by showing error messages separately but allowing users to combine them with 2>&1 when needed.
